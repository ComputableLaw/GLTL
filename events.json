​
The event will have four thematic tracks to help organize and structure activities:
1 Legal document automation (and regulatory processes, with the emphasis on document/permit creation);
2 Data analytics (with the emphasis on context free scenarios);
3 Semantic systems and deep learning (and where there is strong context dependency);
4 Smart transactions (with the emphasis on \'smart contracts\').
​
* The introductions to projects within each track are to be very short (i.e., 3-minute introductions) – more detailed presentations will be done for substantially all of these projects in the working (project development) sessions."
